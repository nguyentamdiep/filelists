LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0171.wav|but it seems to warrant further study before each agency becomes irrevocably committed to separate action.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0283.wav|It was not strange, therefore, that the inmates of Newgate should turn their unoccupied brains and idle hands to all manner of mischief;
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0227.wav|Mr. Brown also, much to his own credit, brought about the abandonment of the practice of ironing all prisoners as a matter of course.

LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0303.wav|It was preposterous to claim for such a scene as this that it conveyed any great moral lesson, or had any deterring influence.

LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0109.wav|Representatives of the local host committee and the White House staff were advised by the Secret Service of the actual route on the afternoon of November eighteen.

LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0120.wav|Robson was found guilty, and sentenced to two terms of transportation, one for twenty and one for fourteen years.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0490.wav|He would have had to cross a deep moat, to scale a wall of burned bricks about twenty feet in thickness and perhaps three times as high,

LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0026.wav|showed how greatly the publicity and wide dissemination of the news regarding murder facilitate the detection of crime.

LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0132.wav|Over the handkerchief around his brows he placed a white cap, the new hat being on top of all.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0162.wav|Other changes affecting the condition and proper treatment of prisoners were not made until the inspector had urged and recommended them.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0012.wav|All three men were committed for trial, although Edwards wished to exculpate the others as having only acted under his order.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0144.wav|On the other hand, the concern he expressed about the FBI may have been just another story to support the objective he sought in his letter.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0260.wav|Another frightful consequence of this indiscriminate admission was the influx of numbers of abandoned women,

LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0054.wav|But incredible as it may appear, the authorities of Newgate declined to avail themselves of the advantages offered them,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0148.wav|After a review of these inconsistencies in his testimony before the Commission, Whaley was interviewed again in Dallas.

LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0113.wav|The scheme was no doubt fascinating, and in many respects feasible;

LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0321.wav|An increase of policemen on duty sufficed to prevent any attempt of this kind.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0298.wav|Oswald could have taken any one of several different buses to Walker's house or to a point near the railroad tracks where he may have concealed the rifle.

LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0170.wav|But he agreed that because the other three bullets were mutilated, he could not determine if they had been fired from the same weapon as the test bullets.
